# Camping Areas

I like camping and I like trying to think of neat useful things to do with R. So I put my hands together and scraped a list of places to camp and then used a Google API to find out how far away those places are from where I live. 

Area types include:
* Texas State Parks
* National Parks
* National Forests
* National Preserves

Requirements:
* R
* Google Distance Matrix API Key
